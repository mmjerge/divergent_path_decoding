Complete your response within approximately 200 words. \n\nTo solve this problem, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p. In this case, we have a = 3 and p = 23. Therefore, we can write 3^22 ≡ 1 (mod 23). Since 47 = 2(22) + 1, we can rewrite 3^47 as (3^22)^2 * 3^1. Using the congruence relation, we have (3^22)^2 * 3^1 ≡ 1^2 * 3 ≡ 3 (mod 23). Therefore, the remainder of 3^47 when it is divided by 23 is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{C}$ \nNote: This problem requires the application of Fermat's Little Theorem, which is a fundamental concept in number theory. The solution involves a straightforward calculation using the theorem, and the answer can be determined quickly and accurately. \n\nIn this case, the correct answer is C) 3.

Complete your response within approximately 200 words. \n\nTo find the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x Z_3, we need to understand what the characteristic of a ring is. The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n such that n \\* 1 = 0, where 1 is the multiplicative identity of the ring. In the case of Z_3 x Z_3, the multiplicative identity is (1, 1), and we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that n \\* (1, 1) = (0, 0). Since Z_3 is a field, we know that 3 \\* 1 = 0 in Z_3.

Complete your response within approximately 200 words. \n\nTo find the characteristic of the ring Z x Z, we need to understand what the characteristic of a ring is. The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n such that n(a) = 0 for all a in the ring, where n(a) denotes the sum of a with itself n times. In the case of the ring Z x Z, which consists of ordered pairs of integers, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that n(a, b) = (0, 0) for all (a, b) in Z x Z. This means we are looking for the smallest n such that na + nb = 0 for all a, b in Z.\n\nThe characteristic of Z x Z is 0 because for any n > 0, there exist a, b in Z such that na + nb ≠ 0. For example, if n = 2, then 1 + 1 = 2 ≠ 0. Therefore, the characteristic of Z x Z is 0.\n\nThe final answer is: A) 0. \n\nNote: The characteristic of a ring is a fundamental concept in abstract algebra, and it is used to classify rings into different types.

The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n such that n times any element in the ring equals the additive identity (0). In the case of Z x Z, we can find the characteristic by considering the possible values of n that satisfy this condition for all elements in the ring.\n\nThe characteristic of Z x Z is 0 because for any element (a, b) in Z x Z, n times (a, b) equals (na, nb), which will only equal (0, 0) if n is a multiple of the characteristic of Z, which is 0. Therefore, the characteristic of Z x Z is also 0.\n\nThe final answer is: A) 0. \n\nNote: The characteristic of a ring is a fundamental concept in abstract algebra, and understanding it requires a solid grasp of ring theory.

A free abelian group is an abelian group that has a basis, which is a subset of the group such that every element of the group can be uniquely expressed as a finite linear combination of elements from the basis with integer coefficients.

We can then substitute x = -3 and y = 2 into this function to find T(-3, 2). \n\nFirst, we need to find the values of a and b.

Solving this system, we find a = 3 and b = -5.\n\nNow that we have the values of a and b, we can substitute x = -3 and y = 2 into the function T(x, y) = 3x - 5y to find T(-3, 2).
